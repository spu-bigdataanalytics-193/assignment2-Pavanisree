In this assignment, we used multiprocessing and multithreading tasks by helping John to reduce time for downloading images from imgur. One to reduce the time of his task in which he was supposed to download 1000 images from imgur, for this purpose we have to first get the client id in order to download the image from imgur.com. The Postman app is used to create a client id. After creating the client id, we have to download images from imgur by using John's codes. By doing so, it took more time but as this is I/O bound operation, so threading is supposed to reduce the time therefore when I used my code for multithreading on the same machine it reduces wall time drastically.
